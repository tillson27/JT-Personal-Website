              I'm a technical product owner and strategy consultant with a background in 
              computer science and business from UBC. I've spent the last few years helping 
              Fortune 500 companies navigate cloud transformations, modernize their tech stacks, 
              and build roadmaps that actually get executed.

              an integration platform for a $100B+ mortgage servicer commercializing their 
              loan servicing software into a multi-tenant SaaS product.
